### Private Repositories

To preserve the intellectual property rights of my professors (and to disallow current students to copy my past work), I will be posting my school projects to private repositories.

Here's a list of my school courses and the projects I completed in them, followed by the language they are coded in and a little information about them:
1. CSCI-322: Android Mobile Device Programming [Fall 2024]
     - AndroidEmailChecker2024 : Java
          - This app was part of the Programmatic UI section, where we were writing Android apps without the use of XML files.
          - The user enters their e-mail address, clicks a button, and is told if it is VALID or INVALID.
     - AndroidContacts2024 : Java
          - This app was part of the Menus and SQLite Database section, where we learned how to store data in an Android app.
          - The user can add, delete, or update a contact. The user can also search by e-mail for a contact.
     - AndroidChessboard2024 : Java
     - AndroidTap2024 : Java
2. CSCI-428: Advanced Android Mobile Device Programming [Spring 2025]
